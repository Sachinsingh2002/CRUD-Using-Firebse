# CRUD-Using-Firebse
For college purposes, I have developed a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application using Firebase to collect and manage students' data, including their roll numbers, names, genders, and addresses. The project consists of four files: an HTML file, a CSS file, and two JavaScript files. One of the JavaScript files is responsible for Firebase configuration, while the other handles the JavaScript code for the CRUD application.

## HTML
The HTML file provides the user interface for interacting with the application, allowing users to input and display student data. The CSS file ensures a visually appealing and responsive design for the application.

## Java Script
In the JavaScript file containing Firebase configuration, I set up the Firebase connection, initializing the app and linking it to the Firebase project. This file also handles authentication and database references for storing and retrieving student data.

The second JavaScript file, dedicated to the CRUD operations, manages the Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionalities for student records. It implements functions to add new students, fetch existing student data from the Firebase database, update student information, and delete records as needed.

## Summary
Overall, this CRUD application using Firebase provides a user-friendly interface for collecting, managing, and organizing students' data effectively, making it suitable for college-related purposes.
